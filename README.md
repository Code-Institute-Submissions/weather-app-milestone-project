# Interactive Font End Development Milestone Project

Welcome to my Weather App project! This simple weather application allows you to get the weather of your location or any other city in the world. It is a well designed single page web app wit the intention in mind of keepig at as simple as possible for the user. The weather app is responsive and works on any device!


# UX 

The web app is designed for a younger audience. I wanted to make sure that it was visualy appealing to young people. 
Most weather apps are pretty boring to look at so i decided to use some special fonts and make it a little art-ish. The web app is easy accessible, everything you need is on one page.
The user can: 

* Get the weather of his location through his IP adress
* Search for the weather of a different city trhrough the search bar on the right upper corner.

# Features

Features:

* Weather ouput based on user location
* Weather output based on city search 
* Ouput of temperature, details (e.g snowy, mist, rain, etc.), city name, humidity, pressure, sunrise and sunset


# Technologies used

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) for page structure
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) for page design
* [Jquery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery) for communicating with 2 api's and adding some interactivity.


# Testing

* HTML and CSS have been validated on [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)
* JavaScript has been checked by a syntax validator calld [Esprima](http://esprima.org/demo/validate.html)
* Website has also been tested manually by searching for a city and getting the correct ouput. 
* Multiple console logs have been performed during coding process to check for errors and to check whether evrything works as it should.
* 


# Deployment

The website has been deployed by using github pages, see: [Github](https://geronimo1992.github.io/weather-app-milestone-project/)


# Credits 

* The code for converting the unix time into human readable time in the function formatTime() on line 69 has been taken from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/847185/convert-a-unix-timestamp-to-time-in-javascript) post on Stackoverlfow. Thank you to the developer of that code for explaining this.
* I learned how to use getTimezoneOffset() through a stackoverflow post that you can find [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1091372/getting-the-clients-timezone-offset-in-javascript)
* Many times i refered to the mozilla developers network which is a huge help in underdtanding lots of things so thank you to all the developers out there!
* If it wasn't for the O'rilleys book "JavaScript the Definitive Guide" i would not have an idea of how to even write the most simplest function (still not sure a hundred percent how to write functions but i am improving!) so thank you to the author David Flanagan for writing such a comprehensive book about such a 
complicated topic as javascript.
* Throug this project i refered to many other online resources and tutorials so thank you to all the authors of those posts as well! Web development for beginners is like the wild west, anything is possible but nothing works! So we appreciate all the posts that make concepts clear and understandable
, you guys our are our heroes!
* Thank you to the tutor support at codeinstitute as well for putting up with my legendary stupid questions during this project, you guys are awesome.
